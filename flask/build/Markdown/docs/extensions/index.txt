Available Extensions
====================

Python Markdown offers a flexible extension mechanism, which makes it possible
to change and/or extend the behavior of the parser without having to edit the
actual source files.

To use an extension, pass it to markdown with the `extensions` keyword.

    markdown.markdown(some_text, extensions=[MyExtension(), 'path.to.my.ext', 'footnotes'])

See the [Library Reference](../reference.html#extensions) for more details.

From the command line, specify an extension with the `-x` option. 

    $ python -m markdown -x footnotes -x tables input.txt > output.html

See the [Command Line docs](../cli.html) or use the `--help` option for more details.

    If you would like to write your own extensions, see the
    [Extension API](api.html) for details.

Third Party Extensions
----------------------

Various individuals and/or organizations have developed extensions which they
have made available to the public.  A [list of third party
extensions](https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown/wiki/Third-Party-Extensions)
is maintained on the wiki for your convenience. The Python-Markdown team
offers no official support for these extensions. Please see the developer of
each extension for support.
